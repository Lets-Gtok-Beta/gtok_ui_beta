Mental wealth:
Life is simple when we forget past and expects nothing from future.
The biggest problem is thinking that only I've a problem and I'm the problem. No, every human being has a problem in their life. Daily, he/she is struggling to solve it.
If you've a problem with outside body, then others can help you. Whereas with inside, then you're the only one to solve it.
