Okay


A friend problem - Thousands of contacts in Social networks and Hundreds of numbers on mobile. But still, I don't know how to start a career. To whom I need to discuss with?



A recruiter - Hundreds of profiles shortlisted in LinkedIn, Indeed and other recruitment platforms. But still, if I want to share an opportunity, I am looking for someone new and start searching again?



An entrepreneur - There are lots of opportunities around. But don't know with whom to share with?



Every one of us faces the same problem in life at different times. For sure, you can't find the same person that you expect in mind in every situation and time.

But yes, you can find a person only in some perspectives.
